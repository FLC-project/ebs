# ebs
(Extended) Berry-Sethi algorithms for the recognition and parsing of a string generated by a regular expression.
Both bs and bsp tools need an HTML browser to run. The browsers Firefox and Chrome are supported (not Explorer).
File bs.html is the standard Berry-Sethi algorithm for constructing the recognizer DFA of a regular expression.
File bsp.html is the extended Berry-Sethi algorithm for constructing the parser DFA of a regular expression, capable to recognize a string and also to build its syntax trees.
